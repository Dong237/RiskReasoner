Since \\(a < b\\), \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be within the interval \\([24, 26]\\) or outside the interval \\([24, 26]\\).\n\nLet's consider the possible positions of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n- If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are within the interval \\([24, 26]\\), then \\(c\\) must be outside this interval to ensure the inequality holds for \\(x < -4\\) and \\(24 \\le x \\le 26\\).\n\nSince \\(a < b\\), we can assume:\n- \\(a = 24\\)\n- \\(b = 26\\)\n- \\(c = -4\\)\n\nNow, we verify these values:\n- For \\(x < -4\\), all factors \\((x-24)\\), \\((x-26)\\), and \\((x+4)\\) are negative, so \\(\\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} > 0\\).\n- For \\(24 \\le x < 26\\), \\((x-24) \\ge 0\\), \\((x-26) < 0\\), and \\((x+4) > 0\\), so \\(\\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} \\le 0\\).\n- For \\(x = 24\\), \\(\\frac{(24-24)(24-26)}{24+4} = 0\\).\n- For \\(x = 26\\), \\(\\frac{(26-24)(26-26)}{26+4} = 0\\).\n- For \\(x > 26\\), all factors \\((x-24)\\), \\((x-26)\\), and \\((x+4)\\) are positive, so \\(\\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} > 0\\).\n\nThus, the inequality \\(\\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} \\le 0\\) is satisfied for \\(x < -4\\) and \\(24 \\le x \\le 26\\), which matches the given conditions.\n\nFinally, we calculate \\(a + 2b + 3c\\):\n\\[\na + 2b + 3c = 24 + 2(26) + 3(-4) = 24 + 52 - 12 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(a + 2b + 3c\\) is \\(\\boxed{64}\\). \n\n", "label": ["+"]}, {"question": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be constants, and suppose that the inequality \\[\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{x-c} \\le 0\\]is true if and only if either $x < -4$ or $|x-25| \\le 1.$ Given that $a < b,$ find the value of $a + 2b + 3c.$", "process": "Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be constants, and suppose that the inequality \\[\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{x-c} \\le 0\\]is true if and only if either $x < -4$ or $|x-25| \\le 1.$ Given that $a < b,$ find the value of $a + 2b + 3c.$\n\n\nGiven the inequality \\(\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{x-c} \\le 0\\), we know that it is true if and only if either \\(x < -4\\) or \\(|x-25| \\le 1\\).

Since the inequality changes sign at these points, we need to determine the order of these points and the intervals they create. Given that \\(a < b\\), we can consider the following possible order of the critical points: \\(a < c < b\\), \\(a < b < c\\), \\(c < a < b\\), \\(c < b < a\\), \\(b < c < a\\), or \\(b < a < c\\).

Identify all possible outcomes when rolling two dice.\n2. Determine which of these outcomes can form a two-digit number between 10 and 20.\n3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all possible outcomes when rolling two dice.**\n\nA standard six-sided die has faces numbered 1 through 6. When rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[6 \\times 6 = 36\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine which of these outcomes can form a two-digit number between 10 and 20.**\n\nA two-digit number between 10 and 20 inclusive must have 1 as its tens digit. Therefore, the possible outcomes are:\n- Rolling a 1 on the first die and any number from 1 to 6 on the second die.\n- This gives us the pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6).\n\nThere are 6 such pairs. However, since we can form two-digit numbers with each pair (e.g., (1, 2) can form 12 and 21), we need to consider both permutations for each pair except when the two numbers are the same (e.g., (1, 1) can only form 11).\n\n- For the pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), each pair can form 2 different two-digit numbers.\n- For the pair (1, 1), it can only form 11.\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n\\[5 \\times 2 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**\n\nThe probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\\[\\frac{11}{36}\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that Melinda will be able to make an integer between 10 and 20 inclusive is:\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}\\] \n\n", "label": ["+"]}]
